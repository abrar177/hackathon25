      <p><strong>What is FindMe?</strong><br><br>
        FindMe is a location-sharing app designed to help students find their peers on campus, especially in large buildings where traditional maps fall short. Unlike Google Maps or Apple’s Find My, FindMe features Augmented Reality (AR) Navigation, allowing users to see real-time directional overlays through their phone camera, guiding them to friends with ease. Whether navigating multi-floor lecture halls, crowded libraries, or hidden study spots, FindMe ensures you can locate your peers quickly and effortlessly. With smart meet-up zones and temporary location sharing, it’s the ultimate tool for staying connected on campus
      </p>
      <p><strong>Why should you use FindMe and how is it unique?</strong><br><br>
        FindMe offers a unique solution by leveraging AR Navigation to guide students to their peers, particularly in large campus buildings where traditional maps are ineffective. Utilizing the phone’s camera and real-time augmented reality overlays, the app provides directional arrows and visual cues to lead users directly to their friends, simplifying navigation in complex spaces such as multi-floor lecture halls and libraries. With features like smart meet-up zones and temporary location sharing, FindMe enhances campus connectivity, saves time, and ensures a seamless experience for students in their daily activities.
